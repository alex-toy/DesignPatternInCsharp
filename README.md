# Design Pattern In C#

## Prototype

The **Prototype** design pattern is a **Creational** design pattern that allows you to create new objects by copying existing objects, which can be useful when creating new objects is costly or complex.


## Mediator

The **Mediator** pattern is a **Behavioral** design pattern. The main intent of the pattern is to have an object that encapsulates interaction between a set of objects. It promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, hence letting you vary their interactions independently.
